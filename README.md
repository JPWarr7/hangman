implementation for hangman in Python (JS implementation in next update.)
### Python Implementation:
#### note: packages must be installed before executing the file. 
nltk is a global dictionary in python, which contains nearly every word in the english language. my hangman implementation requires this package to function, as it uses this dictionary to find a random word to play the game with. PyDictionary is a module designed to take an input and search for its definition. This is used in conjunction with nltk to find a word registered in the dictionary with a proper definition, and once this condition is satisfied the game begins.
